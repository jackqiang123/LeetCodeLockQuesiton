// Given an array of integers that is already sorted in ascending order,
// find two numbers such that they add up to a specific target number.

// The function twoSum should return indices of the two numbers such that
// they add up to the target, where index1 must be less than index2.
// Please note that your returned answers (both index1 and index2) are not zero-based.
//
// You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution.
