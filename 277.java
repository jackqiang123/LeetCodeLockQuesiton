// [LeetCode] Find the Celebrity // Find the Celebrity // Suppose you are at a
// party with n people (labeled from 0 to n - 1) and among them, there may exist
// one celebrity. The definition of a celebrity is that all the other n -
// 1people know him/her but he/she does not know any of them. // Now you want to
// find out who the celebrity is or verify that there is not one. The only thing
// you are allowed to do is to ask questions like: "Hi, A. Do you know B?" to
// get information of whether A knows B. You need to find out the celebrity (or
// verify there is not one) by asking as few questions as possible (in the
// asymptotic sense). // You are given a helper function bool knows(a, b) which
// tells you whether A knows B. Implement a function int findCelebrity(n), your
// function should minimize the number of calls to knows. // Note: There will be
// exactly one celebrity if he/she is in the party. Return the celebrity's label
// if there is a celebrity in the party. If there is no celebrity, return -1.
